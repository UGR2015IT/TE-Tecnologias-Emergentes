#####PROGRAMMABLE MATTER

Everything we're gonna talk about in this presentation falls, directly or indirectly, in the emerging technology known by the name of PROGRAMMABLE MATTER. By definition, it's a matter with the ability to change its physical properties (shape, density, conductivity, etc) via programmation, better via user input or via autonomous sensing. A matter capable of doing this has also the ability to perform information processing. However, such "smart" matter isn't so far in the future: everyday LCD screens are, by any means, programmable matter. Two schools of thought exist as of how to achieve programmability into the matter:
- by "application of physical stimuli" (LCD)
- by "computation by individual unit which form the physical object and its properties"
We'll take a macro-to-micro approach in analyzing this concept.

#####MICROROBOTS

Mobile robots with < 1 mm dimensions, capable of operating components on the microscale; born when microcontrollers appeared (expecially MEMS Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems), their capability of communication has increased since development of wireless connections. They can harvest energy from the surrounding environment (vibrations or light) or use biological motors as power source (Serratia marcenscens). Examples of microrobotics are the Kilobot, small robot unit powered by a button cell e only capable of moving around by vibrating and communicate with its neighbouring similars, and the Monolithic Bee.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

#####NANOROBOTS

Nanotechnology means molecular manufacturing: things are built one atom or molecule at a time with programmed nanoscopic robot arms. Atoms are manipulated individually and placed to produce the desired structure. 
Nanorobots require very little energy to operate, reach micron-level places, may remain operational for a long time because of their long durability and can operate much faster than normal robots. The production of nanorobots has taken a step closer to real application due to technological advancements such as bionic motors, nanotanks, DNA as computer, and nano robotics arms. Their applications are uncountable, including micron-level surgery, blood stream check (heart attack prevention), monitoring of other micro-organisms, or even sun protection as a "cream".

#####SWARM ROBOTICS

Let's imagine we have a huge swarm of tiny robots, not driven by AI or each of them driven by its own AI. This kind of community is said to be decentralized and self-organized: each robot has to interact locally with one another and with the surrounding environment. Decisions have to be taken, a collective behaviour has to be followed. That is SWARM INTELLIGENCE. SI gets inspiration often from nature, especially biological system, in which the agents follows very simple rules, leading to the emergence of "intelligent" global behaviour, unknown to individual agents. Apply SWARM INTELLIGENCE to a swarm of robots and you get SWARM ROBOTICS. A lot of algorithms are being studied, having by reference biological systems: ants, bees, bats, glowworms, our immune system, or bird flocks are just some of the possible examples.
